1. go into wp-content. Then into themes.

2. minimum you need two files index.php and style.css

3.  Visit https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development for more info

4. Next put comments in style css which gives us the details of our Wordpress theme

5. Usually we keep our index.php empty

================================================================

6.  Next we create 4 main template page needed in WP theme: header.php, footer.php, page.php and single.php

7. header.php: code for header or navigation across the wp theme

8. footer.php: contains the code of footer the span across the website

9. page.php: contains the body code {for pages. Like aboutus, contactus} etc. These are pages we create in wp in admin

10. single.php: contains the body code for {single blog post only}

11. home.php: contain body code for {blog page} or {Static Page} of website

12. (front-page.php):It has been deprecated. So we don't necesary need it. Home.php fills in for this page in newer version of wp themes

13. insert:  wp_head() before </head> tag

14. insert:  wp_footer() before </body> tag

15. Next we link our footer and header to other template pages using get_header() and get_footer(); functions

16. bloginfo() is another function which gives us info about our wp site. Like bloginfo('title') gives us the name of our website.

17. 404.php: shows up when we try a page that doesn't exist.

18. archive.php

19. search.php: show us the search result here. And sidebar.php: which show us sidebar

20. Next most important topic is:  the loop. It's the basic unit to customize our posts. And in WP all pages, archives, blog posts---they all are part of THE LOOP post type.

21. It's called "THE LOOP". Becoz it contains many function which starts with "the" word.
<?php 
	if(have_posts()):
		while (have_posts()):
			the_post();
			the_title();
			the_category();
			the_author();
			the_content();

		endwhile;
	endif;
?>

=============================================================================================

22. functions.php:  Function provide various usage in WP. 

23. Like changing language and direction writing(called RTL and LTL) using simple function in head:
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>

24. We can even add rtl.css for this right version of website. WP automatically picks it up.


25. adding extra feature your theme like menu, header are part of: 
add_theme_support(); function

26. add_theme_support('post-thumbnails'); gives us featured images support in our posts.

27. register_sidebar(); gives us access to sidebar in our theme. Do add get_sidebar(); in your template page.

28. add_theme_support('woocommerce'); willl add support for woo commerce in your theme.

29. add_theme_support('title-tag'); will inject title tag dynamiclly.

30. <?php wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'header-menu' ) ); ?> for showing menu in header. But we need to register it in function.php.

===================================================================================================

31. get_template_directory();   gives us the path of directory theme. And its useful when including files. get_stylesheet_directory(); does same thing.

32. But diffrence b/w them is, when their is a child theme and a parent theme-- we use ""get_template_directory();"" for parent theme. And "get_stylesheet_directory();" for child theme

33. Similar to above functions are:
get_template_directory_uri()	-----gives us url of parent theme
get_stylesheet_directory_uri()   ----gives us url of child theme


34. get_stylesheet_uri();	----gives the complete path to style.css file

=============================================================================================

35. Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code in wordpress. They are cruical in theme and plugin interacting with each other or core Wordpress itself.

36. There are two main type of hooks: Action and Filters.
Action hooks does something and get terminated. But filter hooks does something and returns value.

37. Both filters and action hooks can have main 3 functions:
do filter|do actions -- remove filters|remove actions -- add filters|add actions

https://profbrown.org/p/wp_hooks/hook


38. Simple hooks are first defined inside the functions.php and then called on other pages.

// Hooks callback function
function myhook_function() {
	echo "<h1>This is an action hook working!</h1>";
}

//define an action hook
add_action('my_first_hook', 'myhook_function', 10);

// Then in Home.php we call this hook.
do_action('my_first_hook');


39. Priroty(that's the 3rd argument in add_action()) let us know which hook should run first if there are competing hooks.


40. Unlike Action hooks, our filters return data, so they take arugment too. Then this data is filtered(modified in some way) and then given to us by apply_filters().

// Callback function take argument and return the data
function mytextfilter($argument) {
	return "<h2 style='color:red'>$argument</h2>";
}

// Adding filter similar to action hook
add_filter('my_first_filter', 'mytextfilter');

// Calling the filter with argument
echo apply_filters('my_first_filter', "Hello there, this is filtered!");


41. It's recommended by WP to use hooks to register your navbars, sidebars etc. So when sometime website is slow loading then it doesn't break up.
